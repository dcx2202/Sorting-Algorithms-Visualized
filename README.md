## The algorithms do one iteration per draw cycle

Quicksort builds a sorted array from the initial one. The sorted array is displayed alongside the remaining part of the initial one.

Bubble Sort and Selection Sort display each swap in an iteration.

Iterative Merge Sort displays each separation (to/from). (Only does one iteration after a certain number of draw cycles in order to visualize it better).
